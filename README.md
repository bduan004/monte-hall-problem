# monty-hall-problem

Summary:
The monty hall problem is a famous brain teaser popularized by American televesion game show "Letâ€™s Make a Deal", which was originally hosted by Monty Hall. The problem is as follows: Suppose there's three doors, one of which was a car behind it and the other two have goats. You have a chance to guess which door has the car behind it and if you're correct you win the car. After making your first guess, one of the doors that guarenteed has a goat behind it is eliminated (This cannot be your door). Once there's only two doors left, the one you chose and the other door that wasn't eliminated, you have the choice to change your decision. Is changing your decision statistically the right choice?
